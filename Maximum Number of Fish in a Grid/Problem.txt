Problem: Maximum Number of Fish in a Grid

Problem Statement:
You are given an m x n grid.

- grid[i][j] represents the number of fish at that cell.
- 0 represents land (cannot pass).
- Positive value represents water containing fish.

You can start at any water cell and move in 4 directions
(up, down, left, right).

Task:
Return the maximum number of fish you can collect from a connected water region.

Approach:
1. Traverse the grid.
2. For each unvisited water cell:
   - Perform BFS to explore its connected component.
   - Sum all fish in that component.
3. Track the maximum sum among all components.

Algorithm Used:
- BFS (Breadth First Search)
- Grid Traversal
- Connected Components

Time Complexity:
- O(N × M)

Space Complexity:
- O(N × M)
