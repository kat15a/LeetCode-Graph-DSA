Problem: Number of Distinct Islands
LeetCode Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-distinct-islands/

Problem Statement:
You are given an m x n binary grid where:
- 1 represents land
- 0 represents water

An island is a group of connected land cells (4-directionally).
Two islands are considered distinct if their shapes are different.
Rotation and reflection are NOT allowed.

Task:
Return the number of distinct islands in the grid.

Approach:
- Traverse the grid to find unvisited land cells
- For each new island, perform DFS
- Store the relative position of each cell with respect to the starting cell
- The relative positions represent the shape of the island
- Store each island shape in a set
- The number of unique shapes gives the number of distinct islands

Algorithm Used:
- Depth First Search (DFS)
- Shape Encoding using Relative Coordinates

Time Complexity:
- O(N × M)

Space Complexity:
- O(N × M)
