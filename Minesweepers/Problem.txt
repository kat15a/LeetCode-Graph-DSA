Problem: Minesweeper
LeetCode Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/minesweeper/

Problem Statement:
You are given a 2D board representing a Minesweeper game.

Each cell can be:
- 'M' → unrevealed mine
- 'E' → unrevealed empty square
- 'B' → revealed blank square (no adjacent mines)
- '1' to '8' → number of adjacent mines
- 'X' → revealed mine

You are also given a click position.

Rules:
- If a mine ('M') is clicked → change it to 'X'
- If an empty cell ('E') is clicked:
  - If it has adjacent mines → replace it with the count
  - Otherwise → reveal it as 'B' and recursively reveal neighbors

Task:
Return the updated board after the click.

Approach:
- If clicked cell is 'M', mark it 'X'
- Otherwise use BFS:
  - Count adjacent mines
  - If count > 0 → mark with digit
  - If count == 0 → mark as 'B' and explore neighbors
- Use 8-direction traversal

Algorithm Used:
- Breadth First Search (BFS)
- Grid Simulation

Time Complexity:
- O(M × N)

Space Complexity:
- O(M × N)
