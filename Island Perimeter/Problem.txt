Problem: Island Perimeter
LeetCode Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/island-perimeter/

Problem Statement:
You are given a 2D grid where:
- 1 represents land
- 0 represents water

There is exactly one island in the grid.
The island is surrounded by water and does not contain any lakes.

Task:
Return the perimeter of the island.

Approach:
- Traverse the grid to find land cells
- Use BFS to traverse all connected land cells
- For each land cell, check its 4 directions:
  - If the neighbor is out of bounds, increase perimeter
  - If the neighbor is water, increase perimeter
- Sum up all such boundary contributions

Algorithm Used:
- Breadth First Search (BFS)
- Grid Traversal

Time Complexity:
- O(N × M)

Space Complexity:
- O(N × M)
