Problem: All Ancestors of a Node in a Directed Acyclic Graph
LeetCode Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/all-ancestors-of-a-node-in-a-directed-acyclic-graph/

Problem Statement:
You are given a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with n nodes labeled from 0 to n-1
and a list of directed edges.

For each node i, find all nodes that can reach node i (i.e., its ancestors).
The ancestors of a node should be returned in sorted order.

Task:
Return a list where result[i] contains all ancestors of node i.

Approach:
- Reverse the direction of edges:
  - If there is an edge u -> v, then u is an ancestor of v
- Build a reversed adjacency list where v points to u
- For each node i:
  - Perform DFS to find all reachable nodes in the reversed graph
  - These reachable nodes are the ancestors of i
- Sort the ancestor list for each node

Algorithm Used:
- Depth First Search (DFS)
- Graph Traversal on DAG

Time Complexity:
- O(N × (N + E)) in worst case

Space Complexity:
- O(N + E)
