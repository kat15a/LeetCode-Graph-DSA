Problem: Keys and Rooms
LeetCode Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/keys-and-rooms/

Problem Statement:
There are n rooms labeled from 0 to n - 1.
Each room may have keys to other rooms.
You start in room 0.

Task:
Determine if you can visit all the rooms by collecting and using keys.

Approach:
- Treat each room as a node in a graph
- A key from room i to room j represents an edge from i to j
- Start BFS from room 0
- Mark rooms as visited when they are unlocked
- Traverse all reachable rooms using BFS
- After traversal, check if all rooms have been visited

Algorithm Used:
- Breadth First Search (BFS)
- Graph Reachability

Time Complexity:
- O(V + E)

Space Complexity:
- O(V)
