Problem: Number of Islands
LeetCode Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/

Problem Statement:
Given a 2D grid of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands.
An island is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically.

Approach:
- Traverse every cell of the grid
- When an unvisited land cell is found, start BFS
- BFS marks all connected land cells as visited
- Each BFS traversal represents one island

Algorithm Used:
- Breadth First Search (BFS)

Time Complexity:
- O(N × M)

Space Complexity:
- O(N × M)
