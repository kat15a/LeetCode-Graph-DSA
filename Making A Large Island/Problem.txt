Problem: Making A Large Island

Problem Statement:
You are given an n x n binary grid where:
- 1 represents land
- 0 represents water

You may change at most one 0 to 1.

Task:
Return the size of the largest island possible after making at most one change.

An island is a group of connected 1s (4-directionally).

Approach:
1. Treat each cell as a node (r * n + c).
2. Use Disjoint Set (Union-Find) to connect adjacent land cells.
3. For each water cell (0):
   - Check its 4 neighbors.
   - Collect unique parent components using a HashSet.
   - Sum their sizes + 1 (for flipped cell).
4. Also handle edge case where grid contains only 1s.

Algorithm Used:
- Disjoint Set (Union by Size)
- Path Compression
- Grid Traversal

Time Complexity:
- O(n²)

Space Complexity:
- O(n²)
