LeetCode Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-enclaves/

Problem Statement:
You are given an m x n binary matrix grid where:
- 1 represents land
- 0 represents water

A land cell is considered an enclave if it cannot walk off the boundary of the grid
in any number of moves. Movement is allowed only in four directions
(up, down, left, right).

Task:
Return the number of land cells that are enclaves.

Approach:
- Observe that land cells connected to the boundary cannot be enclaves
- Start BFS from all boundary land cells
- Mark al
