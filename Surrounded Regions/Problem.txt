Problem: Surrounded Regions
LeetCode Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/surrounded-regions/

Problem Statement:
You are given an m x n board containing characters 'X' and 'O'.
An 'O' region is considered surrounded if it is completely enclosed by 'X's
on all four sides.

Task:
Capture all surrounded regions by flipping surrounded 'O's to 'X'.
'O's connected to the boundary should NOT be flipped.

Approach:
- Observe that only 'O's connected to the boundary cannot be captured
- Start BFS from all boundary cells that contain 'O'
- Mark all reachable boundary-connected 'O's as safe using a temporary marker '#'
- After BFS:
  - Convert remaining 'O's to 'X' (captured regions)
  - Convert '#' back to 'O' (safe regions)

Algorithm Used:
- Breadth First Search (BFS)
- Boundary Traversal

Time Complexity:
- O(N × M)

Space Complexity:
- O(N × M)
