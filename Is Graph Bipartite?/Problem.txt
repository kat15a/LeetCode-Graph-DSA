Problem: Is Graph Bipartite?
LeetCode Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/is-graph-bipartite/

Problem Statement:
You are given an undirected graph represented as an adjacency list.
The graph may be disconnected.

A graph is bipartite if the nodes can be divided into two disjoint sets
such that no two adjacent nodes belong to the same set.

Task:
Determine whether the given graph is bipartite.

Approach:
- Use graph coloring technique
- Assign colors (0 and 1) to nodes such that:
  - Adjacent nodes always have different colors
- Traverse each connected component using BFS
- If a conflict in coloring is found, the graph is not bipartite

Algorithm Used:
- Breadth First Search (BFS)
- Graph Coloring

Time Complexity:
- O(V + E)

Space Complexity:
- O(V)
