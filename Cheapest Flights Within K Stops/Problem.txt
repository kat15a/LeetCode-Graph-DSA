Problem: Cheapest Flights Within K Stops
LeetCode Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/cheapest-flights-within-k-stops/

Problem Statement:
You are given n cities connected by flights.
Each flight is represented as [from, to, price].

You are also given:
- src: starting city
- dst: destination city
- k: maximum number of stops allowed

Task:
Return the cheapest price from src to dst with at most k stops.
If no such route exists, return -1.

Approach:
- Model the cities as nodes in a graph.
- Build an adjacency list from the flight data.
- Use a modified Dijkstra’s algorithm with a priority queue.
- Each state in the queue contains:
  - total cost so far
  - current city
  - number of stops used
- Always expand the path with the minimum cost.
- Do not continue paths that exceed k stops.
- Use a stops array to avoid revisiting a node with more stops.

Algorithm Used:
- Modified Dijkstra (Shortest Path with Constraints)

Time Complexity:
- O(E log V)

Space Complexity:
- O(V + E)

Interview Insight:
- Standard Dijkstra cannot directly handle stop constraints.
- Tracking stops separately is essential.
- This problem balances cost minimization with path length constraints.
