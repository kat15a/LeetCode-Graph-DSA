Problem: 01 Matrix
LeetCode Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/01-matrix/

Problem Statement:
You are given an m x n binary matrix mat consisting of 0s and 1s.
For each cell, find the distance to the nearest 0.
The distance between two adjacent cells is 1.
Movement is allowed only in four directions: up, down, left, right.

Approach:
- Treat each cell as a node in a grid graph
- Use multi-source BFS starting from all cells containing 0
- Push all 0-cells into the queue initially with distance 0
- Perform BFS to expand layer by layer
- Each BFS level represents distance from the nearest 0
- Store the distance for each cell when it is first visited

Algorithm Used:
- Breadth First Search (BFS)
- Multi-source BFS
- Shortest Path in Unweighted Graph

Time Complexity:
- O(N × M)

Space Complexity:
- O(N × M)
