Problem: Shortest Path in Binary Matrix
LeetCode Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-in-binary-matrix/

Problem Statement:
You are given an n x n binary matrix grid where:
- 0 represents an open cell
- 1 represents a blocked cell

You are allowed to move in 8 directions:
(horizontal, vertical, and diagonal).

Task:
Return the length of the shortest clear path from the top-left cell (0, 0)
to the bottom-right cell (n - 1, n - 1).
If no such path exists, return -1.

Approach:
- This is a shortest path problem on an unweighted grid
- Use BFS starting from cell (0, 0)
- Each BFS level represents one step in the path
- Explore all 8 possible directions from each cell
- Mark visited cells to avoid revisiting
- As soon as the destination is reached, return the distance

Algorithm Used:
- Breadth First Search (BFS)
- Shortest Path in Unweighted Graph

Time Complexity:
- O(N × N)

Space Complexity:
- O(N × N)
