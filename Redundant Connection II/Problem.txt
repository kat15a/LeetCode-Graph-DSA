Problem: Redundant Connection II

Problem Statement:
You are given a directed graph with n nodes labeled from 1 to n.

The graph started as a rooted tree with n nodes,
but one extra directed edge was added.

Task:
Return the edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a rooted tree.

There are three possible cases:
1. A node has two parents.
2. There is a cycle.
3. Both two parents and a cycle exist.

Approach:
1. Detect if a node has two parents using indegree tracking.
   - Store two conflicting edges (bl1 and bl2).
2. Use Disjoint Set (Union-Find) to detect cycle:
   - Skip one conflicting edge if needed.
3. Handle cases:
   - If no node has two parents → return edge causing cycle.
   - If cycle exists after skipping → return first conflicting edge.
   - Otherwise → return second conflicting edge.

Algorithm Used:
- Disjoint Set (Union by Rank)
- Cycle Detection
- Graph Theory (Rooted Tree Property)

Time Complexity:
- O(N * α(N))

Space Complexity:
- O(N)
