Problem: Rotting Oranges
LeetCode Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/rotting-oranges/

Problem Statement:
You are given an m x n grid where:
- 0 represents an empty cell
- 1 represents a fresh orange
- 2 represents a rotten orange

Every minute, a rotten orange rots its adjacent fresh oranges
(up, down, left, right).

Task:
Return the minimum number of minutes required so that no fresh orange remains.
If it is impossible, return -1.

Approach:
- Use multi-source BFS starting from all initially rotten oranges
- Push all rotten oranges into the queue at the beginning
- Perform BFS level by level (each level represents 1 minute)
- In each level, rot all adjacent fresh oranges
- Track time only when at least one orange gets rotted in that level
- After BFS, check if any fresh orange remains

Algorithm Used:
- Breadth First Search (BFS)
- Level Order Traversal (Multi-source BFS)

Time Complexity:
- O(N × M)

Space Complexity:
- O(N × M)
