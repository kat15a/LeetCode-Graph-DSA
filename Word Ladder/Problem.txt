Problem: Word Ladder
LeetCode Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder/

Problem Statement:
A transformation sequence from word beginWord to word endWord
uses the following rules:
- Only one letter can be changed at a time
- Each transformed word must exist in the given word list

Task:
Return the length of the shortest transformation sequence
from beginWord to endWord.
If no such sequence exists, return 0.

Approach:
- Treat each word as a node in a graph
- An edge exists between two words if they differ by exactly one character
- Use Breadth First Search (BFS) starting from beginWord
- For each word, try changing every character from 'a' to 'z'
- If the new word exists in the word list and is unvisited:
  - Add it to the queue
  - Increase the transformation step count
- Stop BFS as soon as endWord is reached (shortest path)

Algorithm Used:
- Breadth First Search (BFS)
- Shortest Path in Unweighted Graph

Time Complexity:
- O(N × L × 26)
  where N = number of words, L = length of each word

Space Complexity:
- O(N)
