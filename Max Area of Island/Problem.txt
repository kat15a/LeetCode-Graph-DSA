Problem: Max Area of Island
LeetCode Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/max-area-of-island/

Problem Statement:
You are given an m x n binary grid where:
- 1 represents land
- 0 represents water

An island is a group of connected land cells (connected 4-directionally).
The area of an island is the number of land cells in it.

Task:
Return the maximum area of an island in the grid.
If there is no island, return 0.

Approach:
- Traverse the entire grid
- When an unvisited land cell is found, start BFS
- BFS visits all connected land cells and counts their number
- The count represents the area of that island
- Track the maximum area among all islands

Algorithm Used:
- Breadth First Search (BFS)
- Connected Components

Time Complexity:
- O(N × M)

Space Complexity:
- O(N × M)
