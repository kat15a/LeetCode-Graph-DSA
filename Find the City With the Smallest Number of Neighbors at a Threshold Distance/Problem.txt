Problem: Find the City With the Smallest Number of Neighbors at a Threshold Distance
LeetCode Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-city-with-the-smallest-number-of-neighbors-at-a-threshold-distance/

Problem Statement:
You are given n cities numbered from 0 to n-1 and a list of weighted edges
where edges[i] = [u, v, w] represents a bidirectional edge between u and v
with distance w.

You are also given a distanceThreshold.

Task:
Return the city with the smallest number of cities that are reachable
at a distance less than or equal to distanceThreshold.
If multiple cities have the same smallest number, return the city
with the greatest index.

Approach:
- Use Floyd–Warshall algorithm to compute shortest distances
  between all pairs of cities.
- Initialize distance matrix:
  - 0 for same city
  - infinity for others
- Fill direct edge weights
- Relax all paths using intermediate nodes (k loop)
- For each city:
  - Count how many cities are reachable within threshold
- Choose city with minimum reachable count
- If tie occurs, choose larger index

Algorithm Used:
- Floyd–Warshall (All-Pairs Shortest Path)

Time Complexity:
- O(N³)

Space Complexity:
- O(N²)
