Problem: High Score
Platform: CSES
Link: https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1673/

Problem Statement:
You are given a directed graph with n nodes and m edges.
Each edge has a weight (which can be positive or negative).

You start from node 1 and want to reach node n.
The score of a path is the sum of weights of its edges.

Task:
Find the maximum score possible.
If the score can be made infinitely large (due to a positive cycle
affecting the path to node n), print -1.

Approach:
- This is a maximum path problem in a graph with possible cycles.
- Use Bellman-Ford algorithm to compute longest distances:
  - Initialize distances with negative infinity.
  - Relax edges (n-1) times.
- If after (n-1) iterations, we can still relax an edge,
  then a positive cycle exists.
- Check whether that cycle can reach the destination node.
  - Use DFS to verify if cycle node can reach node n.
- If yes, print -1 (infinite score possible).
- Otherwise, print the maximum score.

Algorithm Used:
- Bellman-Ford
- Cycle Detection
- DFS Reachability Check

Time Complexity:
- O(N × M)

Space Complexity:
- O(N + M)
