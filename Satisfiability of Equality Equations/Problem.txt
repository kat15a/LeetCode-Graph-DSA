Problem: Satisfiability of Equality Equations

Problem Statement:
You are given an array of strings equations that represent relationships between variables.

Each equation is of one of the following forms:
- "a==b"
- "a!=b"

Each variable is a lowercase letter ('a' to 'z').

Task:
Return true if it is possible to assign integers to variable names
so as to satisfy all the given equations.
Otherwise, return false.

Approach:
1. Initialize Disjoint Set for 26 lowercase letters.
2. First process all "==" equations and union the variables.
3. Then process all "!=" equations:
   - If two variables belong to the same set, return false.
4. If no contradiction is found, return true.

Algorithm Used:
- Disjoint Set (Union-Find)
- Path Compression
- Union by Rank

Time Complexity:
- O(N * α(26)) ≈ O(N)

Space Complexity:
- O(1) (since only 26 variables)
