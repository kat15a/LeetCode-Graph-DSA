Problem: Count Battleships on a Board
LeetCode Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/count-battleships-on-a-board/

Problem Statement:
You are given an m x n board where:
- 'X' represents part of a battleship
- '.' represents empty water

Battleships are placed either horizontally or vertically.
No two battleships touch each other (no adjacent ships).

Task:
Return the number of battleships on the board.

Approach:
- Traverse the board cell by cell
- Count only the starting cell of each battleship
- A cell is the start of a battleship if:
  - It contains 'X'
  - There is no 'X' above it
  - There is no 'X' to its left
- This avoids counting the same battleship multiple times

Algorithm Used:
- Grid Traversal
- Pattern Recognition

Time Complexity:
- O(N × M)

Space Complexity:
- O(1)

Interview Insight:
- BFS/DFS is unnecessary for this problem.
- Recognizing the starting cell of each ship leads to an optimal solution.
