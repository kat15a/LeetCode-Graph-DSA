Problem: Path With Minimum Effort
LeetCode Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/path-with-minimum-effort/

Problem Statement:
You are given a 2D grid heights where heights[row][col] represents
the height of the cell.

You are located at the top-left cell (0,0) and want to reach the
bottom-right cell (n-1,m-1).

The effort of a path is defined as the maximum absolute difference
in heights between two consecutive cells along the path.

Task:
Return the minimum effort required to travel from the start to the destination.

Approach:
- This is a shortest path problem with a modified cost function
- The cost of moving to a cell is the maximum height difference seen so far
- Use Dijkstra’s algorithm with a min-heap
- Always expand the cell with the minimum current effort
- Relax edges by taking:
  max(currentEffort, heightDifference)

Algorithm Used:
- Dijkstra’s Algorithm
- Min-Heap (Priority Queue)

Time Complexity:
- O(N × M × log(N × M))

Space Complexity:
- O(N × M)
