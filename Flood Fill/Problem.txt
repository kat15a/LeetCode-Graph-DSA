Problem: Flood Fill
LeetCode Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/flood-fill/

Problem Statement:
You are given an image represented by an m x n grid of integers.
You are also given a starting pixel (sr, sc) and a new color.
Perform a flood fill on the image starting from the given pixel.

Flood fill means:
- Change the color of the starting pixel
- Change the color of all connected pixels having the same initial color
- Connectivity is allowed only in 4 directions (up, down, left, right)

Approach:
- Store the original color of the starting pixel
- If the original color is already the new color, return the image
- Use BFS starting from the given pixel
- For each pixel, visit its 4-directionally connected neighbors
- Change the color of all valid connected pixels

Algorithm Used:
- Breadth First Search (BFS)

Time Complexity:
- O(N × M)

Space Complexity:
- O(N × M)
