Problem: Largest Component Size by Common Factor

Problem Statement:
You are given an array of unique positive integers nums.

Two numbers are connected if they share a common factor greater than 1.

Task:
Return the size of the largest connected component in the graph.

Approach:
1. Find the maximum number in nums.
2. Create a Disjoint Set of size (max + 1).
3. For each number:
   - Iterate from 2 to sqrt(num).
   - If factor divides num:
       - Union(num, factor)
       - Union(num, num/factor)
4. Count frequency of each parent using HashMap.
5. Return the maximum frequency.

Algorithm Used:
- Disjoint Set (Union by Rank)
- Factorization (up to sqrt(n))
- HashMap counting

Time Complexity:
- O(N * √M)

Where:
N = number of elements
M = maximum value in nums

Space Complexity:
- O(M)
