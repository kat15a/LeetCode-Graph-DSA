Problem: Number of Provinces
LeetCode Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-provinces/

Problem Statement:
You are given an n x n matrix isConnected where isConnected[i][j] = 1 
if the ith city is directly connected to the jth city, and 0 otherwise.
A province is a group of cities that are directly or indirectly connected.

Approach:
- Treat each city as a node in a graph
- Convert the adjacency matrix into an adjacency list
- Traverse each node of the graph
- When an unvisited city is found, start DFS
- DFS marks all connected cities as visited
- Each DFS traversal represents one province

Algorithm Used:
- Depth First Search (DFS)

Time Complexity:
- O(N × N)

Space Complexity:
- O(N × N)
