Problem: Number of Ways to Arrive at Destination
LeetCode Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ways-to-arrive-at-destination/

Problem Statement:
You are given a weighted undirected graph with n intersections numbered from 0 to n - 1.
The roads array contains edges where roads[i] = [u, v, time]
represents a bidirectional road between u and v with travel time time.

Task:
Return the number of different shortest paths from intersection 0 to intersection n - 1.
Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

Approach:
- Use Dijkstra’s algorithm to compute shortest distances.
- Maintain:
  - dist[i] → shortest distance to node i
  - ways[i] → number of shortest paths to node i
- When a shorter path is found:
  - Update dist[v]
  - Set ways[v] = ways[u]
- When an equal shortest path is found:
  - Add ways[u] to ways[v]

Algorithm Used:
- Dijkstra’s Algorithm
- Path Counting with Dynamic Programming

Time Complexity:
- O(E log V)

Space Complexity:
- O(V + E)
