Problem: Smallest String With Swaps

Problem Statement:
You are given a string s and an array of index pairs.

You can swap characters at any pair of indices any number of times.

Task:
Return the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed.

Approach:
1. Use Disjoint Set (Union-Find) to group connected indices.
2. Each connected component represents indices that can be freely swapped.
3. For each component:
   - Collect all indices.
   - Collect corresponding characters.
   - Sort characters.
   - Place them back in sorted order at those indices.
4. Return the constructed string.

Algorithm Used:
- Disjoint Set (Union by Size)
- Graph Connectivity
- Sorting

Time Complexity:
- O(N log N)

Space Complexity:
- O(N)
